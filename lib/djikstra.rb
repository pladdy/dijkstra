# Djikstra
#
# The Djikstra gem implements the djikstra algorithm used in graph theory to
# find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
#
# Classes:
#   - Djikstra::Graph
#   - Djikstra::Node
#
# This gem can also be used as a CLI program by calling it and providing
#   - a file path
#   - a starting node within the file
#   - an ending node within the file
# 
# The CLI command, 'djikstra', returns the shortest path connecting your start 
# and end nodes.
#
# Example: djikstra <file path> <start node> <end node>
